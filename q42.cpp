to calculate the Area of circle, rectangle and traingle i have used the if else/if statement algoritm logic. it was very simple algoritm for me to undertand and complet the assignment. beacuse each clause is indepentend so the best wat was to create it through if else/if statement.
i also tried to use the switch statement but iwas nut so succesful with that. since some of the condition i couldn't figure it out how establish them. for example the range in the switch statement. how insert a condition. 
so please give me some adivses how to add a range condition on the switch statement.
